## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup  
- CSS Custom Properties (design tokens for colors, spacing, typography)  
- HSL color system  
- Flexbox  
- Mobile-first workflow  
- Responsive sizing with `clamp()`, `calc()`, `vw` (no `@media` needed)  

### What I learned

How to create fluid spacing and font sizes with `clamp()`:

```css
--space-500: clamp(1.5rem, 1.5rem + 1.5vw, 2.5rem); /* 24 â†’ 40px */

### Useful resources

MDN â€“ clamp()

W3Schools â€“ CSS Units
