My process
Built with

Semantic HTML5 markup

CSS Custom Properties (design tokens for colors, spacing, typography)

HSL color system

Flexbox

Mobile-first workflow

Responsive sizing with clamp(), min(), max(), vw (no @media needed)

What I learned

How to create fluid spacing and font sizes with clamp():

--space-500: clamp(1.5rem, 1.5rem + 1.5vw, 2.5rem); /* 24 â†’ 40px */


How 1vw works: 1vw = viewport width / 100.

How to calculate vw-based scaling between minâ€“max breakpoints.

Why HSL values need % (e.g. hsl(0 0% 8%) instead of hsl(0,0,8)).

How to replace simple @media queries with fluid units:

.card { width: min(100%, 24rem); }

Continued development

Improve accessibility with :focus-visible for keyboard navigation.

Experiment with container queries for even more component-based responsive design.

Explore transitions and animations for smoother UI feedback.
