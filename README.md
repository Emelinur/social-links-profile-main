## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup  
- CSS Custom Properties (design tokens for colors, spacing, typography)  
- HSL color system  
- Flexbox  
- Mobile-first workflow  
- Responsive sizing with `clamp()`, `calc()`, `vw` (no `@media` needed) 
- @media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)
---
### What I learned

- How to create fluid spacing and font sizes with `clamp()`:

```css
:root {
  --space-500: clamp(1.5rem, 1.5rem + 1.5vw, 2.5rem); /* 24 â†’ 40px */
}
```
- How to make animations accessible using prefers-reduced-motion:
```css
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
  .button {
    transition: none; /* Disable transitions for users who prefer reduced motion */
  }
}
```
